          <p>I would give Splatoon 2 a 3/5 star rating. While the game offers fun and unique gameplay with its ink-spraying mechanics, I found that the single player campaign lacked depth and the online matchmaking could sometimes be frustrating. Additionally, the community can be toxic at times, which can hinder the overall enjoyment of the game. However, the frequent updates and events help keep the game feeling fresh and engaging. Overall, I would recommend Splatoon 2 to fans of multiplayer shooters, but with some reservations.</p>
